# Project Name

Project - Search Interface for Weather Data

> This project is a continuation of my studies focused on front-end web development, and it should be considered
> part of a long journey in web development.
> This site was created with HTML5, CSS3, and JS as part of my learning process.  
> It is a simple interface that allows the end user to perform weather searches for any city (global coverage).

## Features

- [Detailed Functionalities of the JS Script](./src/README_js_explicacao.md)
  
- [Detailed Functionalities of CSS3 Styling](./src/README_css_explicacao.md)

## Technologies Used

- Software - Visual Studio Code (to write the code);
- HTML5 (site structure);
- CSS3 (site styling);
- JS (logic for integration with the end user);
- Git (to manage local and remote interaction via command line);
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for free site hosting).

## Note

> The API key used was provided for free on the site: https://www.weatherapi.com/. This was my first experience with requesting
and consuming real-time data from a server through an API key, along with functions written in JavaScript.
